Particles
=========

A lightweight particle engine written in pure haXe. Based on Particle.as AS2 class by bit-101.

Features
---------

Coming soon.

Examples
--------

Coming soon.


TODO
====

Particle Engine
----------------

*	Make sure the delta timing works properly. This might also fix the "exploding" effect that shows when the window has been resized or something.
*	Particle#turn doesn't do anything right now (should update the Particle#direction property)
*	Emitter might want to use the delta timing to more precisely emit a proper amount of particles (particlesPerFrame would be particlesPerUpdate)
*	Examples and Features (in this README)
*	Add EffectPoint.Deflector - A plane which the particles can bounce off of.
*	Maybe the particles themselves may act as an EffectPoint?

TileMap Engine
---------------

*	Optimize the tileMap sizes. (if it's 64 frames, do 8x8 or 64x1 depending on the width).
*	Should throw errors on one tile is larger than MAX_TILE_WIDTH or MAX_TILE_HEIGHT.
*	TileMaps should have a HSB color interpolation TileEffect
*	TileEffect.Clip is not implemented
*	TileEffect.Filter is not implemented 
*	TileEffect.Alpha looks like shit.
*	TileMap Transforms should be concatenated. Otherwise a Combine( [ Skew() , Scale() ] ) TileEffect won't work.	


Banner
-------

*	Make it configurable using flashvars (text, size, time and url)
*	After a specified time it should add new particles which does not fade, but bounces with the others and then they come up writing a text. At the same time the emitter should stop.
*	RotatingLetterTileMap maybe need to use a rotating textfield instead of the bitmap transform, to get better results.
